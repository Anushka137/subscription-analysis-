# Subscription Analytics Platform

A modern, AI-powered analytics tool for subscription and payment data. Use natural language to get insights, graphs, and reports from your subscription business—either from the command line or via any MCP-compatible client.

---

## Features

- Natural language analytics (Gemini AI)
- Context-aware follow-up queries
- Feedback-driven improvement (CLI)
- Auto-generated graphs (PNG)
- Secure, remote API access
- MCP integration

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- [Gemini API key](https://ai.google.dev/)
- API key for the subscription analytics server
- Internet connection

---

## Quick Start (Command Line)

1. **Clone or download the client code:**

   - Place the `client/` folder on your machine.

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   cd client
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure your credentials:**

   - Edit `client/config.json` (create if missing):
     ```json
     {
       "GOOGLE_API_KEY": "your-gemini-api-key",
       "API_KEY_1": "your-subscription-analytics-api-key",
       "SUBSCRIPTION_API_URL": "https://subscription-analytics.onrender.com"
     }
     ```
   - Get your Gemini API key from https://ai.google.dev/
   - Get your API key from your admin or the server owner.

4. **Run a query:**

   ```bash
   python universal_client.py "How many new subscriptions this month?"
   python universal_client.py "Show payment success rate for last 30 days with graph"
   ```

   - You will be prompted for feedback after each result. Your suggestions help improve future answers.

5. **Interactive mode:**
   ```bash
   python universal_client.py
   ```
   - Type queries interactively. Type `exit` to quit.

## Quick Start (MCP Client)

1. **Install dependencies (if not already):**

   ```bash
   cd client
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Configure your credentials:**

   - As above, ensure `client/config.json` is set up.

3. **Run the MCP server:**

   ```bash
   python mcp_client.py
   ```

   - This will start the MCP server and wait for connections from any MCP-compatible client.

4. **Configure your MCP client:**
   - Add to your MCP client config (see your client's documentation):
     ```json
     {
       "servers": {
         "subscription-analytics": {
           "command": "python",
           "args": ["/absolute/path/to/client/mcp_client.py"],
           "env": {
             "SUBSCRIPTION_API_URL": "https://subscription-analytics.onrender.com",
             "API_KEY_1": "your-subscription-analytics-api-key",
             "GOOGLE_API_KEY": "your-gemini-api-key"
           }
         }
       }
     }
     ```
   - Restart your MCP client if needed.
   - Now you can ask: _"Show me our subscription analytics for the last month"_

## Example Queries (CLI or MCP)

```bash
python universal_client.py "Compare subscription performance for 7 days vs 30 days"
python universal_client.py "How many new subscriptions did we get this month?"
python universal_client.py "What's our retention rate for the last 2 weeks?"
python universal_client.py "Show me database status and recent subscription summary"
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing API key or Gemini key:** Edit `client/config.json` and add the correct values.
- **SSL errors on Mac:** Run `/Applications/Python\ 3.x/Install\ Certificates.command`.
- **Cannot connect to server:** Check your internet, API URL, and API key.
- **Graphs not generated:** Ensure `matplotlib` is installed and `generated_graphs/` is writable.
